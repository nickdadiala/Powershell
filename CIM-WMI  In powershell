# What is CIM
# Cmds like get-CimInstance , Invoke-CimMethod, New\Get-CimSession

# CIm Sessions- Get-WMIObject is equvilant to Get-CimInstance and also has Invoke and Get and new Sessions 

# To get better understanding of WMI and CIM architecture

#WMI/CIM repo and -Namespace Root Vm2 
#WMI Commands is sepcific for RPC service/DCOM whereas CIM is uses WEb service. 
# protocal used to work with remote to DCOM.
Like Managing VM or  server
# mgmtobject and provider and installed and talks to main.

# Working with Classes and properties and Methods..

# Download the Wmi exploer for best rsults.

#  WMI queries with filter options
# Ex: Get-WMiobject Win32_logicdisk -Computername Lonserv1 Oe get-ciminstance Win32_logicdisk -compputername  Lonserv1
# another example : Get -Wmiobject Win32_Logicdisk -filter "deviceID='Z:'" you can also use the -eg  or -ge 
#Get -Wmiobject Win32_Logicdisk -filter "deviceID=Z and Freespace>=5gb"


WQL Syntax
#Select, From , where these are syntax where can be used in powershell 
# Get-Wimobject -Query(param) "Select *from  Win32_logicdisk" or if I only want to fix disk within drive then use where syantax
# Get-Wmiobject -query "Select *from Win32_logicdisk where drivetype=3"
# get-CimInstance With same query will shows table in systematic.
# $session= New-CimSession _computerName Lonserv1
# get-CimInstance -query "Select *from Win32_logicdisk where drivetype=3" -cimSession $session NAd when you use -Computername then you use it and then shutdown and with ssession it will still running at background


#Addintional WMI Language
# Get-WminObject -query " Select* from Win32_logicdisk where -name = 'audio'
# Get-WminObject -query "Select * from Win32_Logicdisk where -name Like "%audio%"  and it will show you only audio and act as wild card

# Get-WminObject -query "Select * from Win32_Logicdisk where -name not Like "%audio%" will show only with not audio 
# Get-WminObject -query "Select * from Win32_Logicdisk where -name Like '[AF]%'" want to havigate to a and f
# # Get-WminObject -query "Select * from Win32_Logicdisk where -name Like '[A-F]%'" And State='stopped'and state='disabled'
