# using variables and strings
# imp to know diff between single and double 
it does make differ when variable is mentioned
 # $value = 'string'
 this is'$value"
 but if you know there is one or more value then use double quote
 ex: "The value of $value is $value"
 and if want to get rid of the line use backtick

 there are some sub expression. 
 like $users.count 
 "there are $users.count user in variable"
 so to fix this use sub expression
 "there are $($user.count) user in varible.
 also can use "+ symbol +"
