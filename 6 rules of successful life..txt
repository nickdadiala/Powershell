-The harsh truth is people will take everything you offer if you don't know when to stop.
-So you can't keep pouring from an empty cup and eventually that kindness will cost you more than you're willing to pay.
-**Kindness without limits will drain your spirit, your time and strength. And here's the thing when you are constantly giving
people stop appreciating what you offer they start expecting it, eventually you will lose sight of your own needs caught in the endless pursuit of keeping
others happy while sacrificing your own happiness.
